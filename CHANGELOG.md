# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add embedded document support to the MongoDB adapter via `embedded_in: { collection_name, path }`. Embedded configs are not dumped as their own jsonl; their `replace_with` rules apply to subdocuments (Array or Hash, with multi-level nesting) inside the parent collection.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Add `bulk_insert_chunk_size` table config to split the generated `INSERT` statement into chunks of the specified size. ([#8](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/8))
- Add experimental MongoDB adapter (`--adapter=mongodb`) that exports collections as JSONL (`insert-{idx}-{collection}.jsonl`). Embedded documents and collection-level `filter` are not supported. ([#10](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/10))
- Introduce `MongodbCollectionConfig` for the MongoDB adapter, with MongoDB-native naming (`fields` instead of `columns`). ([#10](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/10))

### Changed

- **Breaking (MongoDB only):** scenario JSON for the MongoDB adapter must use `fields` instead of `columns`. SQL adapters (`mysql2`, `postgresql`, `sqlite3`) are unaffected. ([#10](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/10))
- Bump minimum required Ruby version to 3.3.0 and drop Ruby 3.2 from the CI matrix (3.2 reached EOL on 2026-03-31).
- Refactor `Adapter` contract to support non-SQL backends: introduce `Adapter#build_query`, `Adapter#output_extension`, and `Adapter#supports_bulk_delete?` hooks. SQL adapters retain existing behavior. ([#9](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/9))
- Extract `exwiw:schema:generate` logic into `Exwiw::SchemaGenerator` so it can be exercised under RSpec without the Rake harness. ([#11](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/11))

### Fixed

- Fix MySQL host access for local rspec runs and switch local dev scripts to inject the password via `MYSQL_PWD` env on `docker compose exec` instead of the `-p` CLI flag. ([#5](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/5))
- Expand `~` in path arguments and validate the existence of `--config-dir`. ([#6](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/6))
- Fix incorrect left-side table in `JOIN ... ON` clause for join chains with 3+ hops, which caused `no such column` / `column does not exist` errors at execute time. ([#7](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/7))
- Fix hard-coded `id` primary key in `QueryAstBuilder` so non-`id` primary keys are honored when expanding `dump_target.ids` into `WHERE`. ([#9](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/9))
- `exwiw:schema:generate` now aggregates `belongs_to` reflections across STI subclasses sharing one table; previously the first-seen class won and subclass associations could be silently dropped. ([#11](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/11))
- `exwiw:schema:generate` now fails fast with `Exwiw::SchemaGenerator::MultipleDatabasesNotSupportedError` when models span multiple `connects_to` databases instead of silently producing a partial schema bound to a single connection. ([#11](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/11))

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- Skip models whose table does not exist in `exwiw:schema:generate` task.
- Add trailing newline to generated schema files.
- Fixed foreign key constraint errors when exporting child tables with filters on intermediate tables. Filters from intermediate tables are now correctly included in JOIN clauses. ([#3](https://github.com/riseshia/exwiw/pull/3))

## [0.1.3] - 2025-04-02

### Fixed

- Generate correct schema when schema is not exist via `exwiw:schema:generate` task.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-03-11

### Changed

- Do not serialize when optional attribute is `nil`.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-03-02

### Added

- Added support for `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` environment variable in `exwiw:schema:generate` task to specify custom output directory for generated schema files.
- When `exwiw:schema:generate` detects schema files in the output directory, it tries to keep filter and masking options.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-31

- Initial release
